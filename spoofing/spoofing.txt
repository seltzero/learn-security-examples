The vulnerability in the provided code is that it does not properly authenticate the user before granting access to sensitive information. In the /sensitive route, the code checks if the req.session.user is equal to 'Admin' and if so, it sets the req.session.sensitive to 'supersecret' and sends a success message. However, there is no proper authentication mechanism in place to ensure that the user is actually the admin.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can manipulate the req.session.user value and set it to 'Admin' without actually being authenticated as the admin. This allows unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information.
