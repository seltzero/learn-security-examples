Privilege escalation is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker gains access to privileges or permissions that they are not authorized to have. This can allow the attacker to perform actions or access resources that are typically restricted, potentially leading to further exploitation of the system.

Here we secure against privilege escalation by using session values so the user cannot modify who they are.
