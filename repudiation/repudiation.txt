Repudiation in the context of information security refers to the ability of a user (typically an attacker) to deny having performed a specific action, making it difficult to hold them accountable for their actions. This is a threat where an attacker could manipulate or delete system logs, perform malicious activities, and then deny any involvement.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Log integrity, digital signatures, access controls, timestamping, etc.
