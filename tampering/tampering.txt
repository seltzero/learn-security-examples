The problem arises because the session ID is not properly protected or validated. In this code, the session secret key, which is used to sign the session ID, is passed as a command-line argument (process.argv[2]). However, this is not a secure way to handle the secret key. Ideally, the secret key should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a configuration file that is not accessible to the public.

This vulnerability violates the integrity property of the CIA triad, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The integrity property ensures that data remains intact and unaltered. In this case, the session data can be tampered with, compromising its integrity. An attacker can modify the session ID, leading to unauthorized access and potentially modifying or manipulating the session data.
