Denial of Service (DoS) is a type of cyber attack where an attacker overwhelms a system or network with a high volume of malicious requests, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. The vulnerability in the code snippet is that it does not handle exceptions when performing a database lookup. This means that if an error occurs during the lookup, the application may crash or become unresponsive, making it susceptible to a DoS attack

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Rate limiting, load balancing, CDN, IPS, firewalls, etc.
